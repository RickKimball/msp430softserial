 * config.h - configure baud rates, xmit/recv pins and ring buffer size
 *
 * The values below are known to work on a launchpad
 * with an msp430g2231 in the socket and a 32.768k
 * crystal soldered onto the board.  The crystal is
 * needed to calibrate the DCO clock to the desired
 * CPU frequency.  The DCO needs to be fairly accurate
 * to achieve the proper bit timing at different
 * baud rates and SMCLK frequencies.

 * F_CPU - To obtain the best results select a UART friendly speed.
 *         Measure the SMCLK speed at P1.4 using a multimeter or oscilloscope.
 *         Verify you are getting your desired frequency. Also, you
 *         will have the best luck if you choose BAUD_RATE and F_CPU
 *         combination that allows the ISR routines to complete before
 *         the next data bit arrives. If you are having problems with
 *         a specific baud rate, use a larger F_CPU value until it
 *         works.  You can test how well it works by use a copy paste
 *         command in your terminal emulator.  That seems to stress
 *         the full duplex aspects of the code.
